# GTFO_VR_Plugin
A BepInEx GTFO plugin to make GTFO in Virtual Reality work almost as well as Subnautica VR!

Active trello board - https://trello.com/b/zSk7bBMS/gtfovr

Requires a BepInEx installation - https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases 

## Installation: 

	Download and install BepInEx in your GTFO game folder
	Follow the instruction on BepInEx's github, launch the game once
	Download and extract the newest GTFO_VR release in the game folder (...common/GTFO/)
	Make sure 'use desktop game theatre' is off in the properties in the steam library
	Start SteamVR
	Go in-game, when you're off the elevator press F1 to play in VR!
	If your controllers don't do anything in-game you might have to download an input scheme

	from the workshop if anyone made one, or create one yourself

	and set action pose to 'tip'!)

	For now the UI is a bit janky so you can toggle it by aiming
	
### Features:
	More or less correctly working VR in-game gameplay (also works in multiplayer!)
	Full SteamVR_Input binding support, you can play with all VR controllers, provided they have 
	enough buttons for all the actions in GTFO!
	Full VR controller based aiming (including fancy laserpointer)
