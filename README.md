# GTFO_VR_Plugin
A BepInEx GTFO plugin to make GTFO in Virtual Reality work almost as well as Subnautica VR!

Active trello board - https://trello.com/b/zSk7bBMS/gtfovr

Requires a BepInEx installation - https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases 

## Installation: 

	Download and install BepInEx into your GTFO game folder (SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GTFO\)
	Follow the instruction on BepInEx's github, launch the game once
	Download the latest version of the plugin from https://github.com/DSprtn/GTFO_VR_Plugin/releases and 
	extract it into the same folder (SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GTFO\)
	Make sure 'use desktop game theatre' is off in the properties in the steam library
	Start SteamVR
	Go in-game, when you're off the elevator press F1 to play in VR!
	For now the UI is a bit janky so you can toggle it by aiming
	
	If your controllers don't do anything in-game you might have to download an input scheme 
	from the workshop if anyone made one, or create one yourself (use the 'old binding UI' menu 
	and set action pose to 'tip'! (or whichever setting you prefer))
	
	Note: When you save your binding SteamVR might not grab the latest poses, in that cases just create another binding, 
	switch to that one and switch back and it will update correctly.


	
### Features:
	More or less correctly working VR in-game gameplay (also works in multiplayer!)
	Full SteamVR_Input binding support, you can play with all VR controllers, provided they have 
	enough buttons for all the actions in GTFO!
	Full VR controller based aiming (including fancy laserpointer)
	


### Known issues: 

	Oculus integration isn't working yet!
	Main menu doesn't work
	In-game HUD is crappy looking 
	Elevator sequence doesn't work correctly in VR 
	Hacking tool minigame isn't rendered correctly for VR
	Flashlight aggro works off of head direction, not weapon flashlight direction
