# GTFO_VR_Plugin
A BepInEx GTFO plugin to make GTFO in Virtual Reality work almost as well as Subnautica VR!

Active trello board - https://trello.com/b/zSk7bBMS/gtfovr

Requires a BepInEx installation - https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases 

## Installation: 

	Download and install BepInEx in your GTFO game folder
	Follow the instruction on BepInEx's github, launch the game once
	Download and extract the newest GTFO_VR release in the game folder (...common/GTFO/)
	Make sure 'use desktop game theatre' is off in the properties in the steam library
	Go in-game, when you're off the elevator press F1 to start-up SteamVR and play!
	If your controllers don't do anything in-game you might have to download an input scheme 
	from the workshop if anyone made one, or create one yourself
	
### Features:
	More or less correctly working VR in-game gameplay 
	Full SteamVR_Input binding support, you can play with all VR controllers, provided they have 
	enough buttons for all the actions in GTFO!
	


### Known issues: 
	Main menu doesn't work
	In-game HUD is crappy looking 
	Elevator sequence doesn't work correctly in VR
